///
/// These are design languages, not devices: a host picks the look it wants and
/// gets it on every platform (`style: PlayerControlsStyle.neumorphic` on
/// Android is a legitimate choice), while [forPlatform] picks the one a
/// platform's users expect by default.
///
/// The sets share one control layer — state, actions, visibility, keyboard —
/// and differ in the parts a viewer actually perceives:
///
/// | style | surface | progress | buttons | notes |
/// | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
/// | [material] | solid scrim, top app bar, overflow menu | thick track, always-visible thumb | ripple | Material 3 accent |
/// | [cupertino] | top/bottom gradient over the picture | hairline that thickens while dragging | opacity dip | counts the time *down* |
/// | [fluent] | acrylic-like translucent panel, thin dividers | thin track, dot that grows | hover reveal + tooltips | volume slider, top-right menu |
/// | [macos] | floating translucent pill | thin track with a small knob | hover, very compact | title in the pill, no full-width bars |
/// | [yaru] | header bar + flat bottom bar | thick track with a round thumb | flat, bordered | Ubuntu orange accent |
/// | [neumorphic] | soft, extruded from one background color | inset groove | soft circular pads, dual shadows | no blur, no pure black |
///
/// Each set is implemented with Flutter primitives rather than the upstream
/// packages (`fluent_ui`, `macos_ui`, `yaru`, …): one dependency-light package
/// that renders the same inside any host tree beats four widget kits that each
/// want their own theme wrapper. Geometry, color, weight and motion follow the
/// language; the glyphs come from [PlayerControlIcons], which a host that
/// already depends on one of those kits can replace with its own icon set.
