/// Playback, seeking, volume, rate, looping and screenshots belong to

/// opening a settings page — depends on how the *host* is built: a kernel with
/// a presentation driver, a navigator route, a window plugin. Those arrive
/// here as callbacks.

/// presence rather than by a capability flag that could disagree with reality.
