/// | iOS | asks for a background task assertion, which buys the transition window rather than unlimited time (see below) |
/// | macOS | keeps the system from idle-sleeping for as long as the session lives |
/// | Windows | `SetThreadExecutionState(ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED)`: the system stays awake, the display may still turn off |
/// | Linux | ⏳ not implemented (logind `Inhibit`); [acquire] reports null there |
///
/// ### What the host controls
///
/// The notification is described by a [BackgroundNotification]: title, second
/// line, icon (a drawable of the host's own, or the glyph shipped for the job's
/// [BackgroundJobKind]) and [BackgroundProgress]. It can be replaced at any time
/// through [BackgroundExecutionSession.update] — which is what a long job uses to
/// show elapsed time or a percentage — and it disappears with the session.
///
/// What is deliberately **not** configurable: buttons/actions (a stop button
/// needs a callback path and a wake-up into Dart, which is a feature of its own),
/// and the Android notification channel (one per library, so a user can silence
/// "background tasks" as a group without hunting per job). Media *playback*
/// notifications are a different surface with a different owner: that is
/// `MediaSessionConfig` in `media_core_mediasession`.
///
/// ### The Android notification permission
///
/// From Android 13 a foreground service shows its notification only with
/// `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`. The plugin declares it and asks for it on the first
/// [acquire] that needs it, while an activity is attached, so a host does not
/// have to know this step exists. A refusal is not a failure: the service and
/// the wake lock still hold — the user simply sees no notification, which is
/// their choice rather than something to fail a recording over.
///
/// ### What this cannot do
///
/// iOS suspends a process that has no reason to keep running, and a network
/// recording is not one — the platform's own answer is the `audio` background
/// mode, which only an app that declares it gets, and only while an audio
/// session is active. [acquire] therefore returns a session that covers the
/// app's transition to the background, and the recording module documents the
/// limit rather than pretending otherwise.
///
/// ### Why a session and not a flag
///
/// The two things a job needs — "somebody has to keep this process running" and
/// "the device must not sleep" — are held by the *platform*, so they have to be
/// released exactly when the job ends. A session object is what makes that
/// release reflexive: `try/finally`, one call, and the notification (or the
/// wake lock) cannot be left behind by a failed path.
