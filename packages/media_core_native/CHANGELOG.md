## 0.2.0

- New background execution capability (`BackgroundJobKind`, `BackgroundExecutionStarter`): one entry point for foreground service, notification, wake lock and keep-awake, shared by audio and recording.
- Permissions are requested by the plugin itself; if the host declines, everything still runs — the notification just is not visible.
- One service carries several sessions, and releasing one only gives up its own slot.
- A recording session must be taken before the process starts, otherwise the foreground service budget is not available to it.

## 0.1.0

- Platform capability probe: codec support, device facts and system features are asked once and carried into every session, instead of re-probing on each playback.
- `canDecodeInHardware` is three-valued: `null` means "not asked yet" and it never returns a false `false`.
- `NativePlatformProvider` / `PlatformProbeReport` carry the probe results; `MethodChannelMediaCoreNative` is the channel implementation.
