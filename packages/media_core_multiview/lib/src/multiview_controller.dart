// The implementation of [MultiviewController] is split by concern across
// `part` files next to this one:
//
// - `multiview_controller_cells.dart`      assign / clear / restart + decode budget
// - `multiview_controller_focus.dart`      video focus, audio focus, patrol
// - `multiview_controller_internals.dart`  cell open/watch/recover, snapshots
//
// Value types live in `multiview_snapshot.dart`. Extensions are public so
// the callable surface of [MultiviewController] is unchanged.

/// Decision trail for the wall.
///
/// A wall is where "why is that camera black" gets asked, and the answer is
/// spread across four mechanisms: the budget, the stall watchdog, the playlist
/// and the focus. Each one records its decisions under `multiview`, so a wall
/// that dropped a cell, restarted one, or never opened one says which.
final LogModule _log = MediaCoreLog.of(LogCategory.multiview);

/// Ledger of the wall.
///
/// A wall multiplies everything the player does by the cell count, including its
/// cost: this account is what answers "how much does this 3x3 grid hold?" and
/// what makes the decode budget auditable after the fact.
final MemoryAccount _memory = MediaCoreMemory.of(MemoryModule.multiview);

/// Runs a wall of live cells.
///
/// Responsibilities:
///
/// - own one player per cell, taken from the core's player host and given back
///   when the cell is cleared
/// - keep exactly one cell audible, and one focused
/// - hold the wall inside the device's decode budget, shrinking it under
///   resource pressure
/// - restart cells that stop making progress, within a bounded budget
/// - rotate the focus on a patrol interval
///
/// It does not:
///
/// - render the grid (the host does, from [snapshot])
/// - resolve room sources or quality ladders (the host supplies sources and may
///   supply a [MultiviewQualityResolver])
/// - own the page, the PiP window or the small window: a cell hands its player
///   over through [handOverCell], and the target is the host's
///
/// ## Why the audio owner is not the same thing as the focus
///
/// The focused cell is the one being *looked* at; the audible one is the one
/// being *listened* to. A monitoring wall usually wants both on the same cell,
/// but a viewer who pinned the audio to one room while looking around the wall
/// is a real use, so they are separate settings with separate setters.
///
/// ## Why the budget is enforced here
///
/// Every cell is a decoder. A wall that ignores that does not show more streams,
/// it shows several broken ones and starves the one the viewer cares about. The
/// core reports pressure ([ResourcePressure]); this controller turns it into a
/// decision ([MultiviewBudgetPolicy]) and reports the result in [snapshot], so
/// the host can show *why* cells went quiet instead of leaving them looking
/// broken.
