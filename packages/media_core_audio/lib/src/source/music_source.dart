/// One platform's music API, expressed as a source.
///
/// The shape follows the "music source" concept a host app plugin ecosystem
/// popularized: a source can *find* tracks and *resolve* them to audio and
/// lyrics, and nothing else in the framework knows how any particular
/// platform works. Implementations live in the host app (they carry
/// site-specific crypto, tokens and headers), so this package only fixes the
/// contract.
///
/// Implementations **extend** this class (`extends MusicSource`) so the
/// optional members below come for free — which is why this is an
/// `abstract class` and not an `abstract interface class`: an interface class
/// could not be extended from outside this library, and the defaults are the
/// point.
///
/// The defaults split by whether an empty answer is *true*:
///
/// - [trackDetail], [qualities], [catalogs] and [resolveLyric] answer "this
///   source has nothing more to say", which is a fact about many sources.
/// - [search] and [catalogItems] throw. A source that cannot search does not
///   have zero results — reporting an empty page would put "no matches for
///   your query" on screen for a platform that was never asked.
