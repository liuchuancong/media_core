/// The music player: one queue, one engine handle, one state snapshot.

/// Built on the same kernel as every other media_core player, but with the
/// decisions a *music* player makes:
///
/// - one handle is created once and re-opened per track, instead of one player
///   per song (engine startup per track is audible and burns a decoder);
/// - playback URLs are cached with their expiry and re-resolved rather than
///   replayed, because they are signed and short-lived;
/// - a failed or never-starting source is refreshed exactly once before the
///   failure is surfaced — one retry is what distinguishes a stale signature
///   from a genuinely unplayable track;
/// - the next track's URL and lyric are prefetched, so pressing "next" is not
///   followed by a stall;
/// - every action funnels through the queue, so "what plays next" has exactly
///   one answer ([PlayQueue]) and not one per call site.
