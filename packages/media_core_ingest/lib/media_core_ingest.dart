/// Playable input pipeline for media_core.
///
/// Live providers hand out sources that a player cannot open as they are: HLS
/// manifests whose children are bare names, absolute-path children, signed URLs
/// that expire mid-stream, per-child tokens, cookies issued with the manifest,
/// containers the player's FFmpeg cannot parse. Without a home for that work
/// every host grows its own relays and its own branching.
///
/// This package owns the decision and the two mechanisms:
///
/// ```dart
/// final plan = resolveIngestPlan(needs: <IngestNeed>{IngestNeed.relativeChildren});
/// switch (plan.strategy) {
///   case IngestStrategy.direct:
///     player.open(Media(source.toString()));
///   case IngestStrategy.manifestRelay:
///     final relay = await LoopbackIngestRelay.start(source: source, headers: headers);
///     player.open(Media(relay.inputUri.toString()));
///   case IngestStrategy.ffmpegRelay:
///     final relay = await FfmpegIngestRelay.start(source: source, executor: executor);
///     player.open(Media(relay.inputUri.toString()));
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The direct path stays the default: a relay costs a process, a port and a
/// second or two of startup, so only a declared [IngestNeed] moves a source.
