/// Turns the system media surfaces on for the whole app.
///
/// The kernel already hands the active player to whichever driver it has, and
/// switches players as playback moves between them — so a single driver serves
/// every player in the process, and the only thing a host has to do is say yes
/// once:
///
/// ```dart
/// void main() async {
///   WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
///
///   // One line at app start: every player created afterwards — video, music,
///   // the feed, the focused cell of a multiview wall — publishes to the
///   // notification, the lock screen, SMTC or MPRIS.
///   await MediaSessionBootstrap.enable();
///
///   runApp(const MyApp());
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Why one driver for the whole process
///
/// The platform has exactly one media notification: one `AudioService` handler,
/// one SMTC session, one MPRIS name. Two drivers would fight over it — and
/// `AudioService.init` asserts in debug on a second call — so this class owns
/// the single instance and hands the same one to every kernel.
///
/// ### Why it is opt-in
///
/// Posting notifications and starting a foreground service is an app-level
/// decision: it needs manifest entries, an icon set and (on Android 13+) a
/// runtime permission. A library that did this behind a host's back would be
/// surprising at best, and a crash in the manifest-less case at worst. Nothing
/// happens until [enable] is called; after that everything is automatic.
///
/// Responsibilities:
///
/// - own the one driver
/// - install it into the kernel's process-wide slot
/// - hand it to a kernel that already exists, or to a host that wants its own
///
/// It does not:
///
/// - decide when a player becomes active (the kernel does)
/// - publish state (the driver does)
/// - request the Android notification permission (the app does; see the README)
