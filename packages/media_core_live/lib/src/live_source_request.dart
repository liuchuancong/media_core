/// declared by the caller on each source, because those are exactly the

/// [LiveSourceRequest.fromUrls] is the exception, and it is labelled as one:
/// most live-site APIs hand over strings and nothing else, so it wraps them —
/// but it can only *infer* protocol and format from the scheme and extension.
/// A caller that knows better than inference should build [sources] directly.
///
/// Recovery scope is declared here as well. The number of sources decides
/// how much *line* fallback there is — and nothing else:
///
/// - Multiple sources: sweep every line on the current engine, then move
///   to the next engine and sweep again, until something plays.
/// - A single source: there is no other line, so the sweep is one engine,
///   one line — but the next engine still gets its turn on the same URL.
///
/// In both shapes the failure is reported to the caller only after every
/// allowed engine has been tried. Pass `allowEngineFallback: false` to
/// refuse engine escalation entirely and have the first failure surface.
