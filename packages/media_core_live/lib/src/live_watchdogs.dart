/// Recovery action requested by [LiveWatchdogs].
///
/// The watchdog only reports what kind of recovery should be attempted.
/// It never owns the player and never calls backend operations directly.
///
/// The actual recovery is executed by the playback owner, normally:
///
/// ```text
/// LiveWatchdogs
///      ↓
/// LiveWatchdogRecoveryAction
///      ↓
/// LivePlaybackController
///      ↓
/// PlayerHandle
///      ↓
/// PlayerAdapter
/// ```

/// Watchdog-driven orchestration for live (non-seekable) streams.
///
/// RxDart is used for watchdog scheduling while the actual live playback
/// semantics remain owned by this class.
///
/// A stall is an inference, not a backend report: the watchdog observed
/// a missing expectation rather than an explicit player error.
///
/// The watchdogs are:
///
/// - [LiveStallKind.sourceReadyTimeout]
///   Opened but produced no playing state in time.
///
/// - [LiveStallKind.unexpectedPauseResumed]
///   Reserved for continuity recovery when an unexpected pause recovers.
///
/// - [LiveStallKind.unexpectedPauseResumeFailed]
///   Reasserted playback did not recover.
///
/// - [LiveStallKind.unexpectedPauseTimeout]
///   Playback remained paused after the continuity retry.
///
/// - [LiveStallKind.bufferingStallTimeout]
///   Buffering never ended within the deadline.
///
/// - [LiveStallKind.videoFrameStallTimeout]
///   Playing state remained true but no new video frame arrived.
///
/// All watchdogs are source-local. The owner should call [cancelAll] when
/// the current source/generation is retired.
///
/// Capability handling follows the single-source-of-truth rule: this
/// class holds a [PlayerAdapterCapabilities] snapshot and reads the
/// fields it cares about directly. It does not declare its own
/// `supportsXxx` flags, mirror getters, or per-capability setters. The
/// snapshot is bound through [updateCapabilities] and re-bound whenever
/// the active adapter changes (fallback, engine switch, close).
///
/// A capability describes what an adapter *can* produce; a session can
/// still rule a signal out. Audio-only playback is that case:
/// [setVideoExpected] with `false` keeps the frame watchdog disarmed for
/// the whole session, because an audio-only source has no video track and
/// therefore never produces the heartbeat it waits for.
///
/// This class intentionally does not execute player operations.
///
/// In particular, it does not:
///
/// - hold a PlayerHandle
/// - call `play()`
/// - call `pause()`
/// - call adapter methods
/// - await backend operations
/// - own recovery Futures
///
/// When recovery is needed it emits [LiveWatchdogRecoveryAction] through
/// [onRecoveryRequested]. The playback owner is responsible for executing
/// that action through the lifecycle-safe PlayerHandle boundary and then
/// reporting the result through [reportRecoveryResult].
