/// One structural idea holds the module together: **every action is a task
/// on a single-slot [TaskManager]** — play, switch line, retry, pause,
/// resume, close, recover. The queue serializes them, so none of the
/// classic live-playback races can exist by construction:
///
/// - a recovery task and a user action cannot interleave — the user's task
///   runs first, and queued recovery work is cancelled when the user takes
///   over ([pause], [close], [play], [retry], [switchLine]);
/// - two rapid `play()` calls cannot double-open — the first is cancelled
///   out of the queue before the second starts;
/// - an engine switch cannot replay a stale request over a newer one —
///   there is no delayed replay anywhere; a switch is just the next task.
///
/// Recovery is a plain function of the caller's declarations, not a
/// subsystem:
///
/// ```text
/// attempt(source, engine) fails
///   → next source on the same engine           (the lines the caller gave)
///   → sources exhausted → next engine, sweep again    (if the caller allowed)
///   → nothing left → PlayerFailure on [onError]
/// ```
///
/// "Fails" means one of: the open threw, the engine could not be attached,
/// or — the case that used to look like a freeze — the source opened
/// cleanly but playback position never advanced within
/// [LiveWatchdogs.sourceReadyTimeout]. Verification is what makes the
/// sweep honest.
///
/// Watchdogs stay pure detectors: a stall or an adapter error becomes a
/// recover task — reopen the current source once, then join the same
/// sweep. The kernel-side recovery ladder is disabled for live players, so
/// there is exactly one recovery path and the caller can read all of it
