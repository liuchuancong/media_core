///
/// - draw the fullscreen layout (the host does)

/// - own picture-in-picture or the small windows (separate packages do)
///
/// ## The two variants
///
/// [PresentationMode.fullscreen] is the platform's own fullscreen: a desktop
/// window covers the screen, a phone hides the system UI. It is a real platform
/// state, so it can fail and has to be restored on exit. On mobile the driver
/// performs the immersive switch itself (`SystemUiMode`); the orientation to
/// lock and the status bar styling are presentation policy and stay with the
/// host.
///
/// [PresentationMode.windowFullscreen] is the host's layout: the video fills
/// the application window while the window stays a window. Nothing platform
/// facing happens here, and the mode is tracked so that PiP, the small windows
/// and the host's own chrome all agree on what is being left when the mode
/// changes.
///
/// Because one driver owns both, it is also the place that guarantees they do
/// not overlap: entering window fullscreen while the system fullscreen is
/// active leaves the system one first. That hand-off cannot be delegated to the
/// driver chain, which only knows about *different* drivers.
///
/// ## Orientation
///
/// Mobile "fullscreen" is not one layout per platform but one per orientation:
/// portrait media fills a portrait screen, landscape media takes the long axis,
/// and a portrait stream on a landscape screen is either letterboxed or
/// rotated. The driver answers that question through [strategyFor] so a host
/// does not re-derive it, and configures it through [FullscreenConfig].
