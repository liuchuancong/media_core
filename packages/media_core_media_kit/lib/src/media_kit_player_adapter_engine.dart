/// The mpv commands that replace a list option's entries.
///
/// A list option cannot be written the way scalars are, and it cannot be
/// written as one comma-joined string either. Both were observed on Windows
/// with `glsl-shaders`:
///
/// - `NativePlayer.setProperty` (`mpv_set_property_string`) with
///   `"a.glsl,b.glsl"` makes mpv open ONE file literally named
///   `a.glsl,b.glsl` — on Windows that fails as an over-long path
///   (`Invalid argument`) and reaches the host as a playback error for
///   whatever source is open.
/// - `change-list <key> set "<a.glsl,b.glsl>"` does the same: this mpv build
///   took the value as a single entry as well (the log proves it — the very
///   joined path is what `file/error` tried to open).
///
/// So each entry travels as its own `append`, and the whole command list
/// starts with `clr` to keep the replace semantics the caller asked for. One
/// argument per entry needs no separator parsing at all, and it also survives
/// an install directory whose path contains a comma.
