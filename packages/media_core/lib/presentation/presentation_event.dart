/// Represents an event emitted by the presentation subsystem.
///
/// Events are immutable descriptions of something that happened.
///
/// Events do not:
///
/// - execute native APIs
/// - modify presentation state
/// - perform transitions
/// - manage lifecycle
///
/// They are consumed by:
///
/// - PresentationController
/// - PresentationReducer
///
/// Platform adapters create events when:
///
/// - a transition starts
/// - a transition completes
/// - a transition fails
/// - the system changes presentation externally
///
/// Flow:
///
/// ```text
/// PresentationRequest
///          │
///          ▼
/// PresentationController
///          │
///          ▼
/// PresentationAdapter
