/// Application-facing video widget for a [PlayerHandle].
///
/// This is the missing bridge between the kernel and the renderer
/// module: a consumer holds a [PlayerHandle], puts a [MediaPlayerView]
/// in the widget tree, and the view
///
/// - asks the attached adapter for its video widget through the
///   [PlayerVideo] interface (every video-capable adapter implements
///   it; adapters without video render the background only),
/// - re-builds when the recovery ladder swaps the backend, because it
///   follows [PlayerHandle.backendChanges] instead of holding on to the
///   previous adapter instance,
/// - fits the surface according to the geometry controller's aspect
///   ratio when the backend reports the video size,
/// - offers its video layer as a screenshot surface, so
///   [PlayerHandle.captureScreenshot] works on engines that have no
///   frame-capture API of their own,
/// - magnifies the video on request, through [zoom] and [enablePinchZoom].
///
/// The view never controls playback. Pausing, muting, recovery and
/// lifecycle belong to the handle; this widget only renders.
///
/// ### Zooming
///
/// Magnification is a transform of the rendered surface, applied *inside* the
/// aspect-ratio box and the capture boundary:
///
/// ```text
/// AspectRatio            the box matches the video, so a magnified picture
///  └ GestureDetector      only when gestures are enabled
///     └ RepaintBoundary   screenshots capture what the user sees
///        └ ClipRect       crops what the magnification pushed outside
///           └ Transform   scale + translation
///              └ PlayerView (fit, mirror) → adapter video widget
/// ```
///
/// The order matters. The transform sits outside `mirror` so a drag always
/// moves the picture with the finger, and inside the clip so magnifying crops
/// the edges instead of painting over the host's UI.
