/// Application-facing video widget for a [PlayerHandle].
///
/// This is the missing bridge between the kernel and the renderer
/// module: a consumer holds a [PlayerHandle], puts a [MediaPlayerView]
/// in the widget tree, and the view
///
/// - asks the attached adapter for its video widget through the
///   [PlayerVideo] interface (every video-capable adapter implements
///   it; adapters without video render the background only),
/// - re-builds when the recovery ladder swaps the backend, because it
///   follows [PlayerHandle.backendChanges] instead of holding on to the
///   previous adapter instance,
/// - hands the viewport fit to the adapter through the [PlayerVideo]
///   contract, so the surface is fitted by the same engine widget that
///   renders it,
/// - offers its video layer as a screenshot surface, so
///   [PlayerHandle.captureScreenshot] works on engines that have no
///   frame-capture API of their own,
/// - magnifies the video on request, through [zoom] and [enablePinchZoom].
///
/// The view never controls playback. Pausing, recovery and
/// lifecycle belong to the handle; this widget only renders.
///
/// ### Layout
///
/// The view does not impose a second layout system on the adapter's widget.
/// Earlier revisions wrapped the surface in an [AspectRatio] plus a
/// fitted [PlayerSurface], but an adapter's video widget already fits
/// itself (and a live stream arriving through the wrapped path could end
/// up composited black while audio played). The adapter's widget now
/// expands into the constraints the host gives this view — a host that
/// wants a letterboxed 16:9 box wraps this view in its own [AspectRatio].
///
/// ### Zooming
///
/// Magnification is a transform of the rendered surface, applied *inside*
/// the capture boundary:
///
/// ```text
/// RepaintBoundary   screenshots capture what the user sees
///  └ GestureDetector
///     └ ClipRect       crops what the magnification pushed outside
///        └ Transform   scale + translation
///           └ adapter video widget (fit, mirror, zoom)
/// ```
///
/// The order matters. The transform sits outside the adapter's own mirror
/// so a drag always moves the picture with the finger, and inside the clip
/// so magnifying crops the edges instead of painting over the host's UI.
