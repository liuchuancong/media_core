/// Zoom and pan applied to one rendered video surface.
///
/// A video is magnified by transforming the surface, not by asking the engine
/// to scale: the transform is engine independent, costs one composited layer,
/// and survives a backend swap. The controller owns the numbers so a host can
/// read them, reset them, or drive them from something other than a gesture
/// (a slider, a remembered value for a feed item, a picture-in-picture window
/// that keeps the inline zoom).
///
/// ### Coordinate space
///
/// The transform maps *content* points to *view* points:
///
/// ```text
/// view = content * scale + translation
/// ```
///
/// Both are view-local pixels — the surface box the video is rendered into,
/// which is the box the enclosing `ClipRect` crops. The caller therefore has to
/// pass that box's size to every operation: it is what the clamping is derived
/// from.
///
/// ### Rest, and why clamping lives here
///
/// Scale 1 is the *rest* state: the video at its natural size, filling a box
/// that already matches its aspect ratio. [reset] returns there, and
/// [isZoomed] compares against it — a host may allow shrinking by setting
/// [minScale] below 1, but "zoomed in" still means "bigger than natural".
///
/// Zooming a video has one hard requirement: the picture must keep covering the
/// view. Allowing the translation to drift means black bars appear while the
/// user drags, which reads as "the video broke" rather than "I reached the
/// edge". [_clamp] enforces it for every mutation, so no caller has to know the
/// rule.
///
/// Responsibilities:
///
/// - hold scale and translation
/// - zoom around a focal point
/// - pan within the allowed range
/// - produce the transform matrix
///
/// It does not:
///
/// - handle gestures (the widget that renders the video does)
/// - know about playback, engines or sources
/// - animate
///
/// Those belong to:
///
/// - MediaPlayerView
/// - PlayerRuntime / PlayerHandle
/// - the host's animation of choice
