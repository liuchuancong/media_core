/// Decides how a [MediaSource] should be handled by a specific

/// [MediaSourcePlanner] is the seam between "what the provider

/// Planning is a pure, synchronous function of `(source,
/// capabilities)`. Anything asynchronous — probing, fetching, opening
/// a backend — is the caller's job after the plan is returned.

/// Responsibilities:
///
/// - map a source plus capabilities to a plan
///
/// It does not:
///
/// - open a backend
/// - fetch or merge media
///
/// Those belong to:
