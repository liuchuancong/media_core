/// Creating and destroying a player per item is the behaviour that makes a feed

/// this orchestration.
///
/// ## What the host tells it
///
/// Visibility, per item, as a ratio — the same number a scroll view computes
/// for an item's intersection with the viewport. Playback follows that number
/// with hysteresis: above [PlayerPoolConfig.playVisibilityThreshold] an item
/// plays, below [PlayerPoolConfig.pauseVisibilityThreshold] it stops, and in
/// between nothing changes, so a partly visible item does not flap.
