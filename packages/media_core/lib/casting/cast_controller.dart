/// The app-facing cast session over a [MediaCastBackend].
///
/// [CastController] turns "a protocol that answers commands" into
/// "a piece of UI state": which devices are present, which one is
/// picked, what is loaded, where its playhead is. It owns exactly the
/// glue a cast needs and nothing a device does:
///
/// - **presence** — devices arrive and leave on the backend stream;
///   a lost device clears an active session instead of leaving a
///   progress bar counting up on a TV that is no longer there;
/// - **the playhead tick** — position is polled on an interval
///   ([positionInterval], default 2s) because DLNA eventing needs a
///   GENA server a Flutter app should not have to run; when one poll
///   fails the previous position is kept and the state marked
///   [unknown], so a transient hiccup grays the ring out rather than
///   snapping it to zero;
/// - **command honesty** — every command awaits, propagates
///   [CastException], and re-reads state after success, because a
///   receiver that accepted SetURI can still refuse to play.
///
/// Responsibilities:
///
/// - expose device/session state as listenables for a picker and a bar
/// - poll the receiver playhead
///
/// It does not:
///
/// - encode protocols (the backend)
/// - keep the local player and the cast in sync (a host that wants
///   handoff composes the two itself)
/// - persist the chosen device
///
/// Those belong to:
///
/// - MediaCastBackend
/// - the host
/// - the host
