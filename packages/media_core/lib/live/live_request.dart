/// fields backend selection reads. A request built from URLs the framework
/// has to re-parse is a request whose selection inputs were guessed.
///
/// Recovery scope is declared here as well: [sources] with more than one
/// entry means "make this play — switch lines, then engines, as needed".
/// A single source means "try this one; if it fails, report and let me
/// decide" — the framework will not silently attach another engine for a
/// request that only ever named one path. [allowEngineFallback] overrides
