///
/// - a recovery task and a user action cannot interleave — the user's task
///   runs first, and queued recovery work is cancelled when the user takes
///   over ([pause], [close], [play], [retry], [switchLine]);
/// - two rapid `play()` calls cannot double-open — the first is cancelled
///   out of the queue before the second starts;
/// - an engine switch cannot replay a stale request over a newer one —
///   there is no delayed replay anywhere; a switch is just the next task.
///
/// Recovery is a plain function of the caller's declarations, not a
/// subsystem:
///

/// Watchdogs stay pure detectors: a stall or an adapter error becomes a
