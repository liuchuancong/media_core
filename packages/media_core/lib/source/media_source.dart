/// - [progressive]: one self-contained stream that already muxes
///   audio and video, e.g. MP4 / MKV files, HLS master playlists,
///   RTMP live lines.
/// - [composite]: several parallel essence streams that must be
///   presented together, e.g. DASH `video.m4s` + `audio.m4s`.

/// It answers "what should play", never "how should it play" — MPV,
/// Media3, FijkPlayer and future backends each decide how to consume
/// the source based on their declared
/// [PlayerAdapterCapabilities.compositeSupport], so a Bilibili DASH
/// pair does not need to know which engine is listening.
