/// Several essence streams that must be presented together.

/// [CompositeMediaSource] models the shape DASH produces and, more
/// generally, any input where video, audio and subtitles arrive as
/// independent resources that share one timeline. Each list holds
/// zero or more candidate tracks; the primary one is the first in
/// the list, and downstream layers can rank alternatives by
/// [MediaTrack.bitrate] without reshaping the source.
///
/// The class is deliberately track-list-based rather than two fields
/// (`videoUrl` / `audioUrl`) because multi-audio (dubbing, director's
/// commentary) and multi-subtitle inputs would otherwise force a
/// second model.
///
/// Responsibilities:
///
/// - group parallel essence tracks under one playable input
/// - expose primary-track shortcuts for the common single-variant case
///
/// It does not:
///
/// - merge or remux anything
/// - decide which backend plays it
///
/// Those belong to:
///
/// - MediaRemuxer (future)
/// - MediaSourcePlanner
