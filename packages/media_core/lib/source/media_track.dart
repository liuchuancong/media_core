/// A single media stream that a player can consume.
///
/// [MediaTrack] is the atomic unit of the source model. Where
/// [PlayerSource] describes a whole playable input, a track describes
/// exactly one stream: one video essence, one audio essence, or one
/// subtitle file. Composite sources such as Bilibili DASH deliver a
/// `video.m4s` and an `audio.m4s` as separate HTTP resources — each
/// becomes one [MediaTrack], and the pair is assembled into a
/// [CompositeMediaSource] so no layer above has to re-derive them.
///
/// A track deliberately keeps the access information (headers,
/// start offset) beside the location, because DASH and HLS segments
/// routinely require per-stream request headers that would be lost if
/// the URL alone were carried.
///
/// Responsibilities:
///
/// - describe one stream's location, media type and per-stream HTTP context
/// - expose enough information for a planner or adapter to schedule it
///
/// It does not:
///
/// - represent a whole playable source
/// - open connections or fetch data
/// - track runtime state
///
/// Those belong to:
///
/// - MediaSource
/// - SourceService
/// - PlayerAdapter
