/// The pure placement engine of the composition layer.
///
/// `TimelineComposer` turns a `PlaybackSchedule` (program plus
/// breaks) into a `ComposedSchedule` (one absolute clock of placed
/// segments). It is a pure function of its input — no clock, no
/// player, no I/O — because the question "what plays at time t" has
/// exactly one answer, and the layer that computes it must be the
/// layer that can be tested without a device.
///
/// The rules the composer owns:
///
/// - breaks are ordered by their position on the program, so a feed
///   that emits an offset-90 pod and a post-roll in any order still
///   plays them in the right order;
/// - a break never moves a later break: placement is computed from
///   program time forward, combined time accumulates behind it;
/// - content is split at every cut, so a content segment's program
///   time and combined time differ by a constant inside the segment —
///   the property that makes `ScheduledSegment.programTimeAt` exact
///   and a resume after an ad land where the viewer left off;
/// - a zero-duration clip is dropped, not placed: a 15-second ad
///   reported with 0 duration by a failing tag would otherwise eat a
///   coordinate and leave an unplayable gap.
