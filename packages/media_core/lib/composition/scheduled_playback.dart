/// Drives one [PlayerHandle] through a composed [PlaybackSchedule].
///
/// The schedule engine answers "what plays at time t" as a pure
/// function; [ScheduledPlayback] is the side of that function that
/// touches the player. It subscribes to the handle's transport
/// stream, feeds every position to a [ScheduleNavigator], and carries
/// out the resulting actions: opening a clip's media when the
/// timeline crosses into it, seeking to the resume point a content
/// segment carries, and completing when the end passes.
///
/// What the host owns that this class deliberately does not:
///
/// - **ad UI and tracking** — [observationStream] reports every
///   navigator observation, which is where "skippable in 5s", the
///   combined progress bar and VAST beacons belong; a controller that
///   fired tracking would be a controller with network side effects
///   at a moment the host did not choose;
/// - **the pause between clips** — [start] opens the first clip and
///   the handle plays on; hosts that want a black frame between
///   program and ad wrap that themselves;
/// - **user intent** — a viewer drag on the combined bar arrives as
///   [seekCombined]; this class never seeks on its own.
///
/// The navigator keeps its own "which segment did I open" state, so
/// a crossing re-opens media even when the previous open has not
/// reported back yet; [start] awaits the first open, and crossings
/// are dispatched serially so a position burst cannot interleave two
/// openMedia calls.
///
/// Responsibilities:
///
/// - execute the navigator's actions against one handle
/// - expose combined-clock control and observation
///
/// It does not:
///
/// - decide placement (TimelineComposer)
/// - fire tracking or render ad UI
/// - survive a handle swap (create a new controller per handle)
///
/// Those belong to:
///
/// - TimelineComposer
/// - the host
/// - the host
