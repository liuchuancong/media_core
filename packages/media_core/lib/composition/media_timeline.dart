/// The presentation timeline of a [MediaSource].
///
/// DASH periods and HLS discontinuities do not all start at media
/// time zero: the audio representation may trail the video by a
/// frame's worth of milliseconds, or both may share a large period
/// base. [MediaTimeline.from] turns those per-track
/// [MediaTrack.startOffset] values into one shared clock — the
/// earliest track pinned at zero, every other track shifted by its
/// distance from that earliest start — so an adapter merging essence
/// streams (MPV's `audio-files`, Media3's `MergingMediaSource`) has a
/// single number to apply per track instead of raw manifest offsets.
///
/// Progressive sources get the trivial timeline: one track at zero.
///
/// Responsibilities:
///
/// - align composite tracks onto one presentation clock
/// - answer time-conversion questions per track
/// - carry the optional segment and cue layers above the alignment
///
/// It does not:
///
/// - know track durations (inspection owns that)
/// - parse subtitle formats
/// - schedule seeks
///
