/// complete when the end is reached. It keeps exactly one piece of
/// state — which clip it last opened — because everything else is a
/// question the composed schedule already answers deterministically.

/// - crossing into an ad means calling `handle.openMedia(ad.source)`;

///   defines *when* would also own *how*, and no test of the when

/// - seeks are user actions arriving out of order (position A → C → B):
///   the state machine tolerates that because it compares against the
///   schedule, not against the previous tick.
///
/// Responsibilities:
///
/// - translate a playhead time into host actions
/// - own skip-eligibility for the clip under the playhead

/// - drive the player or read its position
