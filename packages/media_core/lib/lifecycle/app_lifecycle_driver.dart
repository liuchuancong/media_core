/// Drives a player's lifecycle from the Flutter application lifecycle.
///
/// This is the missing source of truth for the lifecycle module: the
/// handle's [PlayerHandle.activate] / [PlayerHandle.deactivate] were always
/// the designed entry points, but nothing connected the platform's
/// foreground/background transitions to them, so the lifecycle state
/// machine recorded internal paths only.
///
/// The mapping:
///
/// ```text
/// AppLifecycleState.resumed   → handle.activate()
///                               (no auto-play: a TV coming back to the
///                               foreground must not start blaring audio
///                               on its own; the user resumes)
/// AppLifecycleState.inactive  → nothing
///                               (transient: dialogs, iOS app switcher)
/// AppLifecycleState.hidden    → handle.deactivate()
/// AppLifecycleState.paused    → handle.deactivate()
///                               (auto-pause: [PlayerHandle.deactivate]
///                               pauses only when actually playing)
/// AppLifecycleState.detached  → nothing
///                               (the engine is going away anyway)
/// ```
///
/// The driver does not hold a handle. Live playback rebuilds its handle on
/// every engine switch, so a driver bound to one instance would go stale;
/// instead [resolve] is asked for the current handle at every transition,
/// which keeps the wiring correct for whatever player is live.
///
/// Bind once per facade/controller and dispose with it:
///
/// ```dart
/// final driver = AppLifecycleDriver(resolve: () => controller.handle);
/// // ... later ...
/// driver.dispose();
/// ```
