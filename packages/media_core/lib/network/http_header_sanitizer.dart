/// The one rule for caller-supplied request headers.
///
/// Every package that puts a header on the wire used to carry its own copy of
/// this: one dropped the offender and logged, one threw, two rewrote the value
/// into something the site never issued. Four spellings of the same decision,
/// and the decision itself was wrong in three of them — a header that cannot
/// be sent safely is not a thing to work around quietly, because the one that
/// gets dropped is usually `Authorization` or `Cookie`, and what the caller
/// sees afterwards is an unexplained 403.
///
/// So the rule here is: **send it exactly as given, or fail**. Nothing is
/// substituted and nothing is skipped. [HttpHeaderError] names the offending
/// header, which is the information the caller needs and the only thing that
/// was missing from the silent versions.

///
/// Normalization is limited to what cannot change meaning: names are trimmed
/// and lower-cased, and values are trimmed of the optional whitespace around
/// them, because HTTP field names are case-insensitive and field values lose
/// that padding in every parser anyway. Every consumer here (FFmpeg's
/// `-headers`, mpv's `http-header-fields`, ijkplayer's `headers` option,
/// `dart:io`'s HttpHeaders) matches names case-insensitively.
///
/// Values are never rewritten. A value carrying CR, LF or NUL would start a
/// second header line in whichever parser receives it, and replacing the
/// newline with a space would send a cookie or a token the site did not issue.
