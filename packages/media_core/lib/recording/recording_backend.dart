/// A [RecordingBackend] is the lowest-level recording abstraction exposed by

/// to platform APIs, native media frameworks, FFmpeg, or another recording
/// implementation.

/// Responsibilities:
///
/// - report backend availability
/// - start recording from a [RecordingSource]
/// - stop the active recording
/// - cancel the active recording
/// - expose recording state changes
/// - release backend resources
///
/// It does not:
///
/// - manage application-level recording sessions
/// - enforce global recording concurrency
/// - choose between multiple backends
/// - define recording configuration policy
///
/// Those responsibilities belong to:
///
/// - RecordingSession
/// - RecordingManager
/// - backend selection/factory logic
