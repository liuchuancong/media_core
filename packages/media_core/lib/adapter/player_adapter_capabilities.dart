/// Describes capabilities of a player adapter.
///
/// [PlayerAdapterCapabilities] represents static features supported by a
/// playback backend. It is the **single source of truth** for adapter
/// capabilities: every other layer reads fields from an instance of this
/// class and must not re-declare a `supportsXxx` / `xxxSupported` field,
/// getter, or constructor parameter that mirrors a field here.
///
/// Examples:
///
/// - media_kit supports hardware decoding
/// - native player supports platform PiP
/// - a simple backend may not support seeking
///
/// Default values are deliberately conservative: every capability
/// defaults to `false` (or an empty set) except [supportsSoftwareDecoder],
/// which is assumed true because any backend that can decode at all can
/// decode in software. An adapter that supports more must opt in.
///
/// Responsibilities:
///
/// - describe backend features
/// - support adapter selection
///
/// It does not:
///
/// - store runtime state
/// - track playback metrics
/// - manage resources
///
/// Those belong to:
///
/// - PlayerAdapterState
/// - PlayerAdapterMetrics
