/// Template-method base for [PlayerAdapter] implementations.
///
/// [PlayerAdapterBase] owns the scaffolding every backend needs —
/// the event stream, the state machine, lifecycle guards,
/// source-scoped event acceptance and error normalization through
/// [PlayerError] — so a concrete adapter only overrides the engine
/// hooks:
///
/// - [onInitialize] creates the engine and binds its listeners
/// - [onBeforeOpen] / [onOpen] / [onAfterOpen] hand a source over
/// - [onPlay], [onPause], [onStop], [onSeek], [onSetVolume] and
///   [onSetRate] execute the playback commands
/// - [onClose] / [onDispose] release the engine
///
/// Engine callbacks report what happened through the `emit*`
/// helpers. Reports are dropped while the source gate is closed
/// (see [gatesSourceEvents]), and a failure arriving during the
/// open window is deferred until [open] settles, where it either
/// fails the open through [PlayerAdapterOpenException] or is
/// dropped when the engine reports the source as healthy.
///
/// Capability handling follows the single-source-of-truth rule:
/// the only place a `supportsXxx` flag exists is
/// [PlayerAdapterCapabilities]. This base reads [_capabilities]
/// directly and never re-exposes a capability as its own getter,
/// field, or constructor parameter.
///
/// Which `emit*` helpers are capability-gated:
///
/// - **Signal emits** are gated. They describe a signal the adapter
///   promised to produce, and a call without the corresponding
///   capability is a producer contract violation:
///   - [emitVideoFrameProgress] ↔ `supportsVideoFrameProgress`
///   - [emitVideoSizeChanged] ↔ `supportsVideoSizeChanged`
///   - `emitBuffering(progress: …)` ↔ `supportsBufferingProgress`
/// - **Fact emits** are not gated. They describe an engine state
///   transition that has already happened (`playing`, `paused`,
///   `positionChanged`, `volumeChanged`, …). A backend that pauses
///   without declaring `supportsPause` is describing a real event
///   and the report must not be suppressed.
/// - **Command capabilities** (`supportsSeek`, `supportsPause`,
///   `supportsRateControl`, `supportsVolumeControl`, `supportsAudioOnly`, …)
///   do not map to any `emit*` at all; consumers use them to decide which
///   commands to attempt.
///
/// Responsibilities:
///
/// - run the adapter lifecycle templates
/// - publish normalized adapter events
/// - normalize engine failures into [PlayerError]
///
/// It does not:
///
/// - create engine instances (that is [onInitialize])
/// - interpret engine payloads (that is the `emit*` callers)
/// - select backends or retry opens
///
/// Those belong to:
///
/// - PlayerAdapterFactory
/// - LivePlaybackController / FallbackManager
