///   video falls back to the platform default rather than failing the request;
/// - the plugin is Android-only, so iOS reports unavailable instead of
///   pretending.

/// silently doing nothing: the presentation state machine records a failed
/// transition, and the host can tell the viewer why nothing happened.
