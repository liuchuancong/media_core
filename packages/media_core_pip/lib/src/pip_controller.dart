/// Owns the handover between a page and the picture-in-picture window.
///
/// Distinct from the core `presentation` module's `PipController`, which owns
/// the *logical mode state* (entered, transitioning, capabilities). This class
/// owns the *session*: which player is carried, when the window opens on its
/// own, and how the carried player is rendered. The mode controller answers
/// "is the app in PiP?"; this one answers "what is playing in it, and where did
/// it come from?".
///
/// Responsibilities:
///
/// - hold the player the small window carries, above the page's lifetime
/// - decide when to enter and leave, from an [PipAutoEnterPolicy]
/// - build the surface the small window renders
///
/// It does not:
///
/// - own the player (the kernel does; see below)
/// - speak to the platform ([PipDriver] does)
/// - render chrome around the video (the host does)
///
/// ## The handover, and why nothing is re-created
///
/// A viewer who leaves the page while a stream is playing expects the picture
/// to continue — same stream, same position, no gap. That rules out creating a
/// second player for the small window: a new player would re-open the source,
/// re-buffer, and pay for a second decode of the same stream.
///
/// The framework already has the mechanism for this. A [PlayerHandle] belongs
/// to the kernel, not to a page; a video surface is a widget built *from* that
/// handle (`MediaPlayerView(handle: ...)`). So handing over is not a transfer of
/// ownership at all: the page's widget simply goes away with the page, and this
/// controller builds another widget for the same handle in the small window.
///
/// The one thing the host must do is **not dispose the handle** when the page
/// that showed it goes away. Dispose it and there is nothing to carry — the
/// controller reports that rather than opening an empty window.
///
/// ## Page exit and app background are different events
///
/// Leaving the page usually means the host is about to pop a route while the
/// app stays in the foreground; backgrounding the app can happen while the page
/// is still mounted (the viewer pressed home). Both are reported here so the
/// policy can treat them separately, and both are host-triggered because only
/// the host knows when its own navigation or lifecycle events happen. The app
/// side can be wired to the core's `AppLifecycleDriver`, which already observes
/// the platform lifecycle.
