/// [PipWindow] implemented with direct user32 calls — no plugin, no channel.
///
/// `window_manager`'s style APIs are unreliable for hosts that create their
/// window with a hidden title bar (a custom-drawn chrome): the plugin puts
/// such windows on a frameless fast path, after which its style and bounds
/// updates are silently skipped while still reporting success, so a PiP
/// transition through it leaves the window mis-sized with chrome it never
/// had. Every operation here therefore goes through [Win32WindowFfi], which
/// follows the sequence proven by the `fullscreen_window` plugin and the
/// `window_manager` sources themselves —
///
/// - skip taskbar: the `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` bit (what `set_skip_taskbar.cpp`
///   does), so the compact window leaves both the taskbar and Alt-Tab;
/// - resizable: the `WS_THICKFRAME` style bit, kept while compact so the
///   viewer can pick their own size;
/// - top-most: `SetWindowPos` against `HWND_TOPMOST` (via `applyBounds`);
/// - move + resize: one atomic `SetWindowPos` that also carries
///   `SWP_FRAMECHANGED` so style and bounds land together;
/// - restore: a placement snapshot (style/ex-style/placement) captured at
///   [capture] time and replayed, followed by a forced re-layout.
///
/// The custom-drawn chrome is the host's widget, so nothing here touches
/// title-bar styles; the snapshot replays whatever the window had. Free
/// user resizes are allowed while compact (`WS_THICKFRAME` stays), and a
/// snap monitor re-aligns the window shape with the video's aspect once the
/// drag settles — the contained picture never gains black bars. There is no
/// native minimum-size concept, so [setMinimumSize] is a documented no-op.
