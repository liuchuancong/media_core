/// No Dart API reports how many bytes a decoded video stream, a texture or a
/// platform player is holding. The real number lives in native memory, in a
/// codec's internal buffers and in the GPU's allocator, and none of them expose
/// it. So a framework that wants to answer "which module is using the memory?"
/// has two options: report nothing, or report a declared, configurable estimate
/// and say so.
///
/// This file is the second option. The numbers are deliberately round and
/// deliberately conservative: they are meant for *ranking* consumers and for
/// driving a budget, not for telling a viewer how many megabytes are free.
///
/// Measured truth comes from a different place: `MemoryMonitor` takes
/// device-level snapshots from the platform (used/available/external bytes),
/// and a report carries both. When the device says memory is tight and the
/// accounting says the pool holds most of it, the ranking is what matters, and
/// the estimate is good enough for that.
///
/// Hosts that know their own numbers (a player wrapper that can read its
/// decoder's usage, an audio engine with a real buffer size) should report
/// those instead: [MemoryAccount.set] takes whatever they measured.
