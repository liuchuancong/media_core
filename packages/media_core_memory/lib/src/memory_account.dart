/// Every module that holds memory reports into one of these: how many things it
/// holds ([items]) and what they are assumed to cost ([bytes]). The point is not
/// precision — see `MemoryEstimates` — but attribution: when a device is short
/// on memory, the first question is which part of the framework is holding it,
/// and a single total cannot answer that.
///
/// ## One account, many contributors
///
/// An account is per *module*, and a module can have several live instances. So
/// usage is tracked per contributor key and summed:
///
/// ```dart
/// final _memory = MediaCoreMemory.of(MemoryModule.danmaku);
/// late final String _key = memoryContributorKey(this);
///
/// _memory.report(_key, items: _items.length, bytes: ..., note: 'queue');
/// // ... and on dispose:
/// _memory.withdraw(_key);
/// ```
///
/// The simpler [add]/[remove]/[set] family operates on one implicit contributor,
/// for modules with a single instance (the kernel, the pool) where the ceremony
/// would buy nothing.
///
/// Responsibilities:
///
/// - accumulate and release reported usage, per contributor
/// - track peaks, so a spike is visible after it has passed
/// - enforce an optional per-module ceiling
///
/// It does not:
///
/// - measure real memory (reported values are declared or measured by the
///   module itself)
/// - free anything: releasing is the module's job, this is only the ledger
/// - decide global pressure ([MemoryRegistry] does, from the total)
