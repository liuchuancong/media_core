/// - **With a [MemoryRegistry]**: the registry's total is the answer, so the
///   resource layer and the per-module accounting can never disagree. This is

/// - **Without one**: the manager accumulates whatever the caller reports
///   through [updateUsage]/[addUsage]/[removeUsage]. Enough for a host that has
///   its own accounting, or a test.

///
/// - allocate or release native memory

/// - measure the device ([MemoryMonitor] does)
