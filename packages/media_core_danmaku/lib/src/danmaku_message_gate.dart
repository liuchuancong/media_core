/// - **Age**: a message older than [maxMessageAge] is dropped. A socket that
///   kept buffering while the app was backgrounded must not dump a backlog
///   into the view as if it were live chat.
/// - **Identity**: a stable platform id keeps its own long window, because an
///   id is unambiguous and a replay can be rejected without risk. Platforms
///   without ids fall back to a short fingerprint window (type + viewer +
///   text), which is long enough to catch a reconnect replay and short enough
///   that an active chat still shows genuine repetition such as "666".
///
/// Clock skew is tolerated up to [maxFutureSkew]; larger future timestamps are
/// treated as malformed rather than being allowed to poison the id cache.
