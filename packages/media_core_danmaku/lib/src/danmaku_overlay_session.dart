/// Danmaku on a small surface: its own queue, its own bound, its own lifetime.

/// Responsibilities:
///
/// - hold the messages a small surface should draw, separately from the main
///   surface's queue
/// - drop what no longer fits instead of building a backlog
/// - empty itself when the surface goes away
///
/// It does not:
///
/// - decode or filter platform messages (the session does)
/// - draw anything (the host renders [items])
/// - decide when a small surface exists (the host owns the window; this binds
///   to its visibility stream)
/// - own any rendering knob: those are [BarrageConfig]'s, and this class only
///   reads them
///
/// ## Why the queue is separate
///
/// The main surface keeps a long queue on purpose: a viewer reading a busy room
/// wants a backlog. A small window does not — `maxVisibleCount` messages is
/// already more than a 320-pixel window can show before they leave the screen,
/// and a queue that grows while the window is hidden replays stale chat when it
/// returns. Keeping the two apart is what lets both behave correctly.
///
/// ## Why the rendering values are not this class's
///
/// A small window needs smaller text, and the answer to that is a smaller
/// `fontSize` in the [BarrageConfig] handed to this surface — the same answer
/// the engine gives. A second set of knobs here, with its own names and its own
/// scaling rules, is how one surface ends up drawing at a size the other
/// surface's config never mentioned.
///
/// ## Binding instead of depending
///
/// [bindVisibility] takes the visibility stream of whatever surface this
/// overlay belongs to — `PipDriver.onPipChanged`, `FloatingDriver.
/// onFloatingChanged`, or a host's own signal. The danmaku package therefore
/// knows nothing about picture-in-picture, floating windows or their platform
/// drivers, and those packages need no danmaku dependency to be usable.
