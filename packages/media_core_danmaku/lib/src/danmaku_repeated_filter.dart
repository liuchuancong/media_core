/// viewer who does not want to read that line ten times wants this filter.

///
/// - Only [DanmakuMessageType.chat] is affected; gifts and paid messages are
///   never collapsed.
/// - Local and system messages are never affected, so echoing the viewer's own
///   send is always visible even if the room is spamming the same words.
/// - Disabling the filter clears the window instead of freezing it, so
///   re-enabling starts a fresh window rather than suppressing text that was
///   seen before the filter was turned off.
