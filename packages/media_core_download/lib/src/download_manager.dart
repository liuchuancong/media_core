/// Decision trail for the download queue.
///
/// The questions a download bug report asks are all here: why did it not start
/// (queue capacity), why did it start over (the resume check rejected the
/// partial file), and why did it stop (retry budget spent, or a failure that is
/// not retryable).
final LogModule _log = MediaCoreLog.of(LogCategory.download);

/// Ledger of the in-flight transfers.
///
/// Reported in measured bytes rather than estimates: a download knows exactly
/// how much it has written, so this account is one of the few that is a real
/// number — and it is the one that explains a process growing while a large file
/// is being fetched.
final MemoryAccount _memory = MediaCoreMemory.of(MemoryModule.download);

/// The download queue.
///
/// Responsibilities:
///
/// - own the task list and each task's download status
/// - schedule transfers through the core task queue, which bounds concurrency
///   and orders work by priority
/// - resume a partial file after verifying it, or restart it when it cannot be
///   trusted
/// - retry a failed transfer within its budget
///
/// It does not:
///
/// - decide where files go (the task carries a path)
/// - persist the queue across restarts (the host stores tasks; a task's file and
///   the resume check make restoring one cheap)
/// - fetch bytes itself (a [DownloadTransport] does)
/// - **reimplement queueing or retry**: the core's [TaskManager] owns concurrency
///   and ordering, [TaskId]/[PlayerTask]/[TaskState] own task identity and
///   lifecycle, and [RetryUtils] owns the attempt policy
///
/// ## Why the core queue is used here
///
/// Capping concurrency, ordering by priority and cancelling in-flight work are
/// the same problems for a download as for a player operation, and the framework
/// already solves them once. A second scheduler inside this package would be a
/// second place to fix whenever scheduling is wrong, and it would report task
/// state in a vocabulary the rest of the framework does not understand.
///
/// ## What is genuinely download-specific
///
/// Two things, which is why this class is not just a wrapper:
///
/// - **pause**: a download can be suspended by the viewer and continued later.
///   The core queue's states are created/queued/running/terminal, so a paused
///   task leaves the queue while keeping its partial file — and does not silently
///   restart the moment a slot frees up.
/// - **resume verification**: a partial file is only appended to after its tail
///   has been proven to match the remote one (see [DownloadResumePlanner]).
///
/// ## Fixed concurrency
///
/// [DownloadConfig.maxConcurrent] is applied when the queue is created: the core
/// queue pins its capacity at construction, so changing the limit means building
/// a new manager rather than quietly keeping the old one.
